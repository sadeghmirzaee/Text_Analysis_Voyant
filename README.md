# Text_Analysis_Voyant
Here I document my research in text analysis, powered by Voyant. The HTMLs are Spyral notebooks.
Voyant is a web-based tool. It is the most user-freindly of the available tools.

In these research project, I would analyze familiar texts. The objective is to "test" the outcomes of the text analysis with my previous knowldge.
